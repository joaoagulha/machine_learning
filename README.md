# Machine Learning

This repository contains code for established Machine Learning algorithms.

It goes through different Regression and Classification supervised problems. Then, it dives into unsupervised problems, namely, clustering. After that, it explores different association and reinforcement learning algorithms. Afterward, it makes a brief introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP). Finally, it explores dimensionality reduction and Model Selection algorithms.
